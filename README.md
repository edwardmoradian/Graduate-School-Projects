# Graduate-School-Projects
This is a repo of some of the projects that I completed in my graduate school career at 
California State University, East Bay as a M.S. Statistics Student.

The link to the presentation on hard stochastic attention on Youtube is https://youtu.be/FAUsGldirko

The other projects are about Bayesian inference and history, a multivariate linear regression model, a k-means clustering machine learning model and a data visualization project using Tableau.
